# Interview Me for Plan

Read @plan.md and interview me in detail using the AskUserQuestionTool about literally anything: technical implementation details, scientific validity, performance, code concerns, tradeoffs, etc.

Make sure the questions are not obvious.

Be very in-depth and continue interviewing me continually until it's complete, then write the plan to the file.
